  # Skips checking to make sure top level modules / classes have a comment.
  Enabled: false

Style/ClassAndModuleChildren:
  # Skips checking the style of children definitions at classes and modules.
  #
  # Basically there are two different styles:
  #
  # `nested` - have each child on a separate line
  #   class Foo
  #     class Bar
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # `compact` - combine definitions as much as possible
  #   class Foo::Bar
  #   end
  #
  # With it disabled, either or is valid.
  Enabled: false

Metrics/LineLength:
  # Commonly used screens these days easily fit more than 80 characters.
  Max: 120

Metrics/MethodLength:
  # Too short methods lead to extraction of single-use methods, which can make
  # the code easier to read (by naming things), but can also clutter the class
  Max: 20

Layout/SpaceAroundEqualsInParameterDefault:
  # No space makes the method definition shorter and differentiates
  # from a regular assignment.
  EnforcedStyle: no_space

Style/SymbolArray:
  # We do not need to support Ruby 1.9, so this is good to use.
  Enabled: true

Style/PercentLiteralDelimiters:
  # Because percent literals are closer to method calls, use parenthesis.
  PreferredDelimiters:
      default: ()
      '%i': '()'
      '%w': '()'
